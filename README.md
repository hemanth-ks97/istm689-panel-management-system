## Project Structure
This is a monorepo for the entire system and consists in three components
- Infrastructure as code (IaC) (terraform directory)
- Backend (backend directory)
- Web Application (webapp directory)

## Setup

### Initial setup from scratch

Requirements:
- AWS Account
- [Terraform Cloud](https://app.terraform.io/) account
- Code repository supported by Terraform Cloud
  - Currently supported developer platforms are: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure DevOps

In order to setup the project from zero we need to follow these steps: 
- Create a `terraform` IAM user
- Attach `AdministratorAccess` policy (or whatever you want to give it)
- Generate and store an access key (later to be used)
- Create two workspace and project on Terraform Cloud
  - This project **needs** `production` and `dev` workspaces created
- Link the project to the repository
- Add environment variables
  - Note: Each workspace have isolated environment variables
  - To interact with AWS we need to set: 
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`: Access Key ID for the AWS user to be used by terraform
    - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: Secret Access Key for the AWS user to be used by terraform
    - `TF_VAR_GITHUB_TOKEN`: Access token from GitHub with read-only access to the repository
    - `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (optional): If we want to use a custom domain hosted on Cloudflare

## Developer Setup

### Requirements
Need to install the following dependencies
- Python 3.11.7
- Node v18.17.1
- AWS CLI

### Run Frontend
To run the frontend you need to run the following commands
```bash
# Move to webapp directory 
cd webapp
# Install node packages
npm install
# Run react development server
npm start
# It should open the default browser on http://localhost:3000
# Stop react development server
# Press Ctrl C
```

### Run the Backend 
To run the backend you need to run the following commands
```bash
# Move to backend project directory
cd backend/pms-core 
# Install python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run Chalice on local server
chalice local --stage local
# It should be ready to test queries on http://localhost:8000
# Stop Chalice local server
# Press Ctrl C
```
